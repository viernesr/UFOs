# UFOs

## Overview

Earlier in the module, an app is required to filter UFO findings based on date. The filter occurs within a click of a button, using exact string matching, to get the matching results. Now, we would like to add more filters, specifcally onces based on city, state, country, and shape of the sighting. In addition, the button is removed, so that when the filters are added within the input boxes, they would immediately be applied.

## Results

When the webpage first loads, every entry from the site is loaded into the webpage. At the bottom, there are five text boxes. At least one textbox must be filled in order for the filter to work. Once a textbox is filled, the only entries shown which has a match to the inputted entry. An example of a filter can be shown [here.](./images/filter_example.PNG)

## Summary

One drawback of the webpage is how the entries have to be exact.

One suggestion can be giving suggestions to what the user is looking for, if the entry or entries aren't exact within the textboxes.
